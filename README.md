# patchcompose-drafts

save/load pathless drafts in localStorage.

this hooks into `patchcompose-insert`,
that interface was intended for inserting links,
but also works for drafts because it gives a handle
to the textarea. The draft is saved under the
name of the page that the composer sits on.

There maybe some stuff to work out for drafts
on channels or with private recipients...
but we'll cross that brigde when we come to it.
